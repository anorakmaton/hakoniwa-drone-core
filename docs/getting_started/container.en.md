# Getting Started: Container Pattern (With Hakoniwa)

When using the Hakoniwa Drone Simulator with the **Container Pattern (with Hakoniwa)**, you can use Docker containers to **run the physical and control models separately**.
In this configuration, it is possible to **integrate with Unity, Unreal Engine, ROS2, the Web, etc., via a Bridge**.


ðŸ“˜ [See the overview and configuration image of the entire container pattern](/docs/architecture/overview.md)

## âœ… Features

*   Each component (PX4/Ardupilot, hakoniwa-drone-core, hakoniwa-core, etc.) is containerized independently.
*   Simplified installation with docker.
*   Connect with ROS2, the Web, Python scripts, etc., via a Bridge.
*   Can also run on WSL2 and in the cloud.
*   Integration with gamepads and XR is also possible.
