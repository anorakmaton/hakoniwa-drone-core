# Documentation Generation Instructions

The `docs/prompts` tree holds task prompts and templates for generating documentation and tests with AI assistance. Each component directory now organizes prompts into numbered files such as `01_api-doc.md`, `02_test-spec.md`, and `03_test-code.md`.

Use the templates under `docs/prompts` when creating new prompts.
